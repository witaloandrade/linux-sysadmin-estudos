# Haproxy_lab01

This Repo is the result of my experience on learning haproxy from the book Load Balancing with HAProxy, which I've decided to read and study. 

This is the books link from amazon.

After finishing the lab I've decided to write the code with docker compose because I  thought that it would be a great opportunity to learn also docker compose.
